## Import

In this exercise we use data of the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). The data is available at <https://washdata.org/data> and published as an R data package at <https://github.com/WASHNote/jmpwashdata/>.

The data set `jmp_wld_sanitation_long` is available in the `data` folder of this repository. The data set is in long format and contains the following variables:

-   `name`: country name
-   `iso3`: ISO3 country code
-   `year`: year of observation
-   `region_sdg`: SDG region
-   `residence`: residence type (national, rural, urban)
-   `varname_short`: short variable name (JMP naming convention)
-   `varname_long`: long variable name (JMP naming convention)

We use the `read_csv()` function to import the data set into R.

```{r}
sanitation <- read_csv("data/jmp_wld_sanitation_long.csv")
```

## Task 1

1.  Run all code chunks above.

2.  Use the `glimpse()` function to get an overview of the data set.

3.  How many variables are in the data set?

    8 columns -\> 8 variables

```{r}

glimpse(sanitation)
```

## Task 2

1.  Use the `count()` function with varname_short and varname_long to identify the definitions of the levels in these two variables.

    1 san_bas basic sanitation services 14742

    2 san_lim limited sanitation services 14742

    3 san_od no sanitation facilities 14742

    4 san_sm safely managed sanitation services 14742

    5 san_unimp unimproved sanitation facilities 14742

```{r}

sanitation |> 
  count(varname_short, varname_long)
```

## Task 3

1.  Use the `filter()` function to create a subset of the data set that only contains observations:

-   for a country of your choice,
-   for the year 2000 and 2020,
-   for all variables that are not "safely managed sanitation services".

2.  Store the result as a new object in your environment with a name of your choice.

```{r}

sanitation_china_2000_2020 <- sanitation |> 
  filter(iso3 == "CHN", year == 2000 | year == 2020, varname_long != "safely managed sanitation services")
```

## Task 4

1.  Use the `count()` function with the data you created in Task 3 to verify that year 2000 and 2020 remained in the year variable.

```{r}

sanitation_china_2000_2020 |> 
  count(year)
```

## Task 5

1.  Use the `ggplot()` function to create a bar plot with `geom_col()` for the data you created in Task 3.

2.  Use the `aes()` function to map the `residence` variable to the x-axis, the `percent` variable to the y-axis, and the `varname_long` variable to the fill aesthetic.

3.  Use `facet_wrap()` to create a separate plot for each year.

4.  Change the fill colors using `scale_fill_colorblind()`.

5.  Add labels to the bars by copying the code below this bullet point and adding it to your code for the plot.

```         
geom_text(aes(label = round(percent, 1)), 
          position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
          size = 3,
          color = "white") 
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = sanitation_china_2000_2020,
       mapping = aes(x = residence,
                     y = percent,
                     fill = varname_long)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(percent, 1)), 
          position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
          size = 3,
          color = "white") 
```

## Task 6

If you haven't worked with JMP indicators before, the following questions will be challenging to answer.

1.  Look at the plot that you created. What do you notice about the order of the bars / order of the legend?

    I haven't worked with JMP indicators before, but I will do my best to answer haha. The order of th bars vertically follows the order of the legend and vice versa.

2.  What would you want to change?

    I think it would be more intuitive to have the longest bars on the bottom, i.e. to flip the whole graph around.

3.  Why did we remove "safely managed sanitation services" from the data set in Task 3?

    Because all the NAs disrupt the data and the graph would look like this:

## Task 7

1.  Run the code in the code chunk below.

2.  What do you observe when you look at the code and plot?

    The plot is faceted into fifteen different subplots corresponding to the three categories "national", "rural" and "urban" and the five categories of sanitation, each with their own adjusted axes.

```{r}

sanitation_2020 <- sanitation |> 
  filter(year == 2020)

ggplot(data = sanitation_2020,
       mapping = aes(x = percent, fill = varname_short)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(varname_short ~ residence, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") 

```

## Task 8: Data communication

**In the YAML header (between the three dashes at the top of the document)**

1.  Add your name as the author of this document
2.  Render the document and fix any errors

## Task 9: Complete assignment

### Stage, Commit & Push to GitHub

1.  Open the Git pane in RStudio. It's in the top right corner in a separate tab.
2.  **Stage** your changes by checking appropriate box next to all files (if you select one file with your mouse, you can then highlight them all with Ctrl + A on your keyboard and check all boxes).
3.  Write a meaningful commit message (e.g. "Completed part b of homework assignment 03.) in the **Commit message** box.
4.  Click **Commit**. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.

### Open an issue on GitHub

Once you have ensured that the Quarto document renders without errors and you have pushed all your changes to GitHub, you can complete the assignment by opening an issue on

1.  Open [github.com](https://github.com/) in your browser.
2.  Navigate to the GitHub organisation for the course.
3.  Find the repository md-03-assignments that ends with your GitHub username.
4.  Click on the "Issues" tab.
5.  Click on the green "New issue" button.
6.  In the "Title" field write: "Completed module 3 assignments".
7.  In the "Leave a comment" field, tag the course instructors @larnsce and ask some questions, if you like.
